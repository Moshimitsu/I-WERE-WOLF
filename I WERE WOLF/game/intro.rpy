"If you ask me about my wish, I wonder how an answer would look like."
"Before you come to any conclusion, I'll make things clear: I'm not some kind of egoist... not in the way you expect me to be at least."
"Fame, money, power... Actually it's incomprehensible for me to desire something like that."
"But let's go back to the main topic."
"One day my wish would be 'I really do want to be invisible!', the other - 'Just go to hell all of you!', but in the end it's always..."
"'Please, don't be like that to me... I won't harm you...'"
"Actually all my wishes can be described by one word."
"Acceptance."
"The only one I have and the only one that cannot be fulfilled."
"You wonder why, right? You see, I'm not a rebel or someone like that, always being polite to the others and willing to help - sometimes..."
"I do not want to hurt people, but this message can't get through one's prejudice."
"Why?"
"That's because..."
"I'm a werewolf."

"There're some countries that secure equality of rights but modern Japan is immature."
"People only see monsters killing their relatives to satisfy hunger and murderous desires."
"It's not true!"
"We have no choice! We can't control our bodies, it's changing by itself every single month."
"If we try to resist, we must endure unimaginable pain."
"Wanna know? Set on fire your own blood and stay still for five minutes."
"Imposible? You don't have to be ashamed. I knew you couldn't bear this pain. I knew it all along."
"For us, every time when the full moon shines on the starry sky, it's like that."
"We can lighten our suffering by changing forms and going berserk."
"You see, we really have no choice."
"But I want to tell you a secret."
"I resist this urge for few years now and made my health worsen. And never wanted human flesh."
"And still, I'm nobody but a monster."
"It's not fair."
"'I really wanted to be your friend'"
"But both school and my neighbourhood rejected me."

"It was like that until last year."
"No one knows."
"No one has the slightest idea."
"And I'm happy."
"If I keep a safe distance, I'll make it 'till graduation."
"That's what I thought."
"But today..."
